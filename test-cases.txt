Result: PASS

Test 1.7 - Multi-Symptom PSU (compound)
Symptoms: no-power-at-all + post-beep-codes
Expected: psu-failure (R1) and motherboard-post-failure (R3); R7 does not fire because R1 already concluded psu-failure
Result: PASS


Module 2 - Display and Graphics (Victor)
Victor authored Module 2 -> David reviewed Module 2

Test 2.1 - GPU or Cable Failure
Symptom: no-display-output
Expected: gpu-or-cable-failure, confidence moderate
Result: PASS

Test 2.2 - GPU Overheating or Memory Defect
Symptom: screen-artifacts
Expected: gpu-overheating-or-memory, confidence strong
Result: PASS

Test 2.3 - Display Connection Issue
Symptom: monitor-not-detected
Expected: display-connection-issue, confidence moderate
Result: PASS

Test 2.4 - GPU Driver Failure
Symptom: driver-crash-recovery
Expected: gpu-driver-failure, confidence strong
Result: PASS

Test 2.5 - Multi-Symptom GPU (compound)
Symptoms: no-display-output + screen-artifacts
Expected: gpu-or-cable-failure (R8) and gpu-overheating-or-memory (R9); R12 does not fire because R9 already concluded gpu-overheating-or-memory
Result: PASS


Module 3 - Memory and Storage (David)
David authored Module 3 -> Robert reviewed Module 3

Test 3.1 - RAM Seating or Compatibility
Symptom: ram-not-in-bios
Expected: ram-seating-or-compatibility, confidence strong
Result: PASS

Test 3.2 - RAM Module Failure
Symptom: blue-screen-crashes
Expected: ram-failure, confidence strong
Result: PASS

Test 3.3 - Storage Connection Failure
Symptom: storage-not-detected
Expected: storage-connection-failure, confidence strong
Result: PASS

Test 3.4 - Boot Storage Not Found
Symptom: boot-device-not-found
Expected: boot-storage-failure, confidence strong
Result: PASS

Test 3.5 - Storage Failing
Symptom: slow-storage-access
Expected: storage-failing, confidence moderate
Result: PASS

Test 3.6 - Multi-Symptom Storage (compound)
Symptoms: boot-device-not-found + storage-not-detected
Expected: storage-connection-failure (R15) and boot-storage-failure (R16); R18 does not fire because R15 already concluded storage-connection-failure
Result: PASS


Session and Utility Rules

Test 4.1 - Session Initialization
Input: any single reported symptom
Expected: session-state started; "DIAGNOSTIC SESSION STARTED" printed
Result: PASS

Test 4.2 - No Symptoms Prompt
Input: (reset) then (run) with no symptoms
Expected: R21 fires once, prints valid symptom ID list; does not repeat
Result: PASS

Test 4.3 - Session Completion
Input: any symptom that produces a conclusion
Expected: R20 fires last, prints "DIAGNOSTIC SESSION COMPLETE"
Result: PASS

Test 4.4 - Suggest Next Steps (strong confidence)
Symptom: no-power-at-all
Expected: R22 fires; suggests hardware swap test
Result: PASS

Test 4.5 - No Next Steps Suggestion (moderate confidence)
Symptom: intermittent-power
Expected: R22 does not fire; no swap test suggestion printed
Result: PASS


Cross-Module Tests

Test 5.1 - Symptoms from Multiple Modules
Symptoms: no-power-at-all + screen-artifacts + ram-not-in-bios
Expected: psu-failure (strong), gpu-overheating-or-memory (strong), ram-seating-or-compatibility (strong); no cross-module interference
Result: PASS

Test 5.2 - All 15 Symptoms
Input: all 15 symptom IDs via driver menu (1-15 then 0)
Expected: 15 conclusions; R7, R12, R18 do not fire due to guard clauses
Result: PASS

Test 5.3 - Driver Menu Integration
Input: (load "driver.clp"), (reset), (run-diagnosis), enter 1 3 11 0
Expected: no-power-at-all, post-beep-codes, ram-not-in-bios asserted; 3 diagnoses produced
Result: PASS


Negative and Edge Cases

Test 6.1 - Invalid Symptom ID
Input: (assert (reported-symptom (symptom-id nonexistent-symptom) (observed yes)))
Expected: session starts but no conclusion produced; no crash
Result: PASS

Test 6.2 - Symptom Observed = No
Input: (assert (reported-symptom (symptom-id no-power-at-all) (observed no)))
Expected: no rules fire (diagnostic rules require observed=yes; R21 does not fire because a reported-symptom fact exists)
Result: PASS

Test 6.3 - Duplicate Symptom Assertion
Input: same symptom asserted twice
Expected: CLIPS prevents duplicate; only one conclusion produced
Result: PASS
